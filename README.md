TODO list:
* Oral microbiome decoy and/or classification support for the saliva sequences.
* Make revert-bam.sh recognize unmapped bam from content and/or extension and skip unmapping.
* See about workflow creating unmapped bam on the fly without needing to store it.
* Add some of my scripting for creating unmapped bam from fastq files automatically.
* Try to reproduce decoy sequence creation from BAC/fosmid clones to include new ones.
* Do same for de novo assembled Personal Genomes Project sequences.
* Validate and compare results with GIAB and others.
* Publish my variant calling scripts.
